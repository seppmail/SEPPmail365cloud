# SEPPmail365Cloud module version 2.0.0 release info

## Startup

* M: The Doc-link in init-screen points now to docs.seppmail.com
* M: Require ExchangeOnlineManagement Version 3.7.1 as minimum
* M: Require PowerShell 7.5.0 as minimum version
* B: Do not run on Windows PowerShell and blocks module load
* M: If an M365 Tenant is dehydrated, raise a warning instead of an error. This allows Inline customers to continue installation because the module loads.

# New Output-Format Rules and Connectors

```powershell
Connect-ExchangeOnline -Device
import-module SEPPmail365cloud
Get-SC365Setup
```

This will show the new output format, so all relevant info of rules and connectors shows up on one screen.

## Bug/Feature New-SC365Rules Setup

* The -whatIf parameter in New-SC365Rules now does NOT delete transport rules if SEPPmail.cloud rules exist.

```powershell
# Try this, must not change anything in an existing setup
New-SC365Rules -whatIf
```

## Enhancements in Mailflow

* Fake crypto headers like [secure] or [signed OK] being sent inbound, are now matched only against the subject and not subject or body.
* Rules trigger also HIN and signed invalid subjects
  
# SEPPmail Support addresses are added to allowed sender list

```powershell
get-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity default|select allowedSenders
New-SC365Setup
get-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity default|select allowedSenders

```

* New-SC365Connectors now checks if transport rules still point to the connector and stops if this is the case.

```powershell
# Try in a deployed tenant
New-SC365Connectors
```

## Features

### New-SC365Setup checks if given parameters fit to cloud deployment

There are 2 ways to run this CmdLet:

1. Without any parameters
2. With some or all parameters -routing -region -SEPPmailCloudDomain

### Running New-SC365Setup without parameters

The CmdLet runs Get-SC36Deployment in the background and takes parameters from the output for the mail flow configuration

>!Info: Setups with New-SC365Setup are always __active immediately__

### Running with parameters

```powershell
# Add correct parameters and overwrite the autodetect feature from get-sc365DeploymentInfo
New-SC365Setup -SEPPmailCloudDomain 'contoso.at' -region de -routing inline
# would be a full functioning all to run a setup.
```

### New-Feature New-SC365Setup now allows multiple domains in the -SEPPmailCloudDomain parameter

This only makes sense in a parallel environment, as we add those domains to the outbound rule.

```powershell
New-SC365Setup -SEPPmailCloudDomain 'contoso.com','fabrikam.com' -routing parallel -region prv -whatIf
```

### New feature - Parameter checking for New-SC365Setup

Now if you i.e. mistype a parameter value or just enter the wrong region, the CmdLet New-SC365Setup will now run Get-SC365DeploymentInfo anyway and compare your manual input with the info detected by the cloud setup. If it differs it will raise warnings/errors.

__Warnings__ when:

* the domain is part of the Exo Tenant but not the Default Accepted domain\n

__Errors__ when:

* the value of the 'region' parameter is wrong
* the value of the 'routingType' parameter is wrong
* the domain is not part of the Exo-tenant
* there are transport rules pointing at connectors in -whatIf mode

```powershell
#Run without Parameters
New-SC365Setup -verbose -whatIf
```

```powershell
# Run with non-default tenant default domain will switch to the tenant default domain
New-SC365setup -domain fabrikam.com -region prv -routing parallel -whatIf
```

```powershell
#run with typo in domain we take the tenant default domain
New-SC365setup -domain wrongdomain.com -region prv -routing parallel -whatIf
```

## SEPPmail support-addresses are added, when installing the connectors

```Powershell
Get-HostedContentFilterPolicy -Identity default|select-Object -Expandproperty allowedSenders
```

## Added a warning for setups in Inline Mode that inline setups affect all domains

```Powershell
# Run on an INLINE Setup
New-SC365Connectors -Routing inline -Region ch
```

## The Update-SC365Setup CmdLet

The new cmdLet has a user confirmation and a large block of explanaition of how it works. 
Start it and read the info.
